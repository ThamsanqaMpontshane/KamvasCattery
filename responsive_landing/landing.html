                I’m a cheerful chatterbox. The best companion of them all, I’ll follow you around all day, meowing in my
                friendly way. I’m a loving teenage girl with a whole lot of cuddles to share with you! I enjoy playing
                with my cat friends – rolling about in the sun

                I am highly affectionate and I just love to play! I am quite a jealous lover though and would really
                prefer to be an only cat. I don’t play well with others but if you give me your whole heart, I’ll return
                it to you tenfold , promise you

                I may seem a little, my coat a little battered – but oh, do I know how to love!
                I’ve spent lifetimes alone and grown tired of the roam – I’m looking for my forever
                home, could it be you? I’m a softy, a teddy with my heart stitched upon my sleeve,

        <p class="p4">
          A registered <span>non-profit organisation</span> , Kamva Cat Shelter is one of the country’s leading animal
          welfare organisations.
          Our mission is to provide a sanctuary for companion cats in need, striving to end homelessness, neglect and
          abuse in the communities we serve through medical assistance, humane education, rescue, rehabilitation and
          rehoming.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p4">
          We believe we can do this by fostering a partnership approach through individual and corporate giving, and by
          working together with community and animal welfare groups to create a better world with compassion and
          understanding towards animals.
        </p>
        <p class="p5">
          Together we CAN make a difference.
